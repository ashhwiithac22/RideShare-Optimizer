🚗 Ride Sharing and Trip Planning System

A Python-based web application built using Streamlit and NetworkX to optimize ride-sharing routes and multi-stop trip planning using powerful graph algorithms like BFS, Prim's, and TSP (Branch & Bound).

🔧 Features

🚘 Ride Sharing Optimization
Supports shared rides for 2 to 5 users

Calculates shortest and cost-effective paths

Visualizes optimized routes on interactive maps

🗺 Multi-Stop Trip Planning
Create routes with multiple destinations

Choose between:

Fixed order of stops

TSP-optimized path for minimum distance

Displays total distance, estimated time, and cost

📊 Algorithms Used
Shortest Path – BFS (via Dijkstra’s algorithm)

Minimum Spanning Tree – Prim’s algorithm

Traveling Salesman Problem – Branch & Bound approach
