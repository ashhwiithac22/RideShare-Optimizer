A graph-based optimization system that implements BFS (shortest path), Prim's (MST), and TSP algorithms to enable efficient ride-sharing and multi-stop trip planning.

## Key Features

- ðŸš˜ **Ride Sharing Optimization**:
  - Finds optimal shared routes for 2-5 riders
  - Calculates distance, time, and cost savings
  - Visualizes shared routes on interactive maps

- ðŸ—º **Multi-Stop Trip Planning**:
  - Plans optimal routes with multiple stops
  - Two modes: Fixed order or TSP-optimized
  - Calculates total distance, time, and cost

- ðŸ“Š **Algorithm Implementations**:
  - BFS (Dijkstra's) for shortest path finding
  - Prim's algorithm for network analysis
  - Branch & Bound for Traveling Salesman Problem

Algorithm Complexity
Algorithm	           Time Complexity	     Space Complexity
BFS (Dijkstra's)	 O(E + V log V)	             O(V)
Prim's MST         	O(E log V)	                O(V + E)
TSP (Branch & Bound)	O(n!)	                  O(n)
